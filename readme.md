# Jobbo - A Job Aggregator
Jobbo is a job aggregator that I built to help me save time in my job search. It finds Software Engineer jobs from [Weworkremotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/) every Monday at 9am, does some filtering, and stores the results in a database so it's easy for me to check and apply.
